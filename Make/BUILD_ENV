#               File for manipulating all IVI builds
#               ====================================
#
# This file sets up environment options for all IVI builds. It can be overridden by
# BUILD_ENV* files in program (like) directories, but it is too difficult and
# hazardous for library code, so options for the library need to be in BUILD_ENV*
# files in $MAKE_PATH (e.g., possibly this file). 

# Generally, we only use this file as a stop gap. For example, we might force
# the version of boost until we fix the code so that it works with reasonably
# young boosts. Currently, reasonably young means at least 1_69. 

# Example forcing boost to be between 1_69  and 1_71. 

# setenv IVI_BOOST_VERSION "1_71:1_70:1_69"
