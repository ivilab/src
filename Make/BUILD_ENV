#               File for manipulating all IVI builds
#               ====================================
#
# This file sets up environment options for all IVI builds. It can be overridden by
# BUILD_ENV* files in program (like) directories, but it is too difficult and
# hazardous for library code, so options for the library need to be in BUILD_ENV*
# files in $MAKE_PATH (e.g., possibly thus file). 

# I am suggesting we force boost 1_69 or better.

setenv IVI_BOOST_VERSION "1_71:1_70:1_69"
