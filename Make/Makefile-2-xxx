# Template for Makefile-2 for a library directory. Usually operated on by the
# script ivi_add_makefiles or the build system. 
#
# If we are not in the main IVI library directory, then the directory that we
# are in should have a different name than any IVI library sub-dirs. 
#
# Replace 'xxx' with the directory name, and XXX with the upper case counterpart
# (not currently used).  The string that replaces 'xxx' should not already be a
# sub-dir of IVI library. 
#
# Then, DELETE_THIS_COMMENT_BLOCK, because it is no longer a template! 

# Changes to the automatically built Makefile-2 in library directories will be
# overwritten by the build processis. Hence, tweaks to Makefile-2 MUST BE USED
# ONLY FOR TRANSITION.
