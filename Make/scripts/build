# Build script 
# ============
#
# This file is generally called by "make". It can also be called directly. The
# main purpose is to normalize the make environment, and to implement some
# functionality that is difficult to do in efficiently, or robustly, or portably
# using make. 
#
# This file should be a copy of: 
#     ${KJB_SRC_PATH}/Make/scripts/build 
#
# The chief functionality implemented here is to determine the value of
# KJB_SRC_PATH, followed by sourcing ${KJB_SRC_PATH}Make/scripts/build-2. 
#
# This is a copy of ${KJB_SRC_PATH}/Make/scripts/build so that source directories can
# be moved up and down in the src directory tree without additional manual
# operations. If we instead were to link to ${KJB_SRC_PATH}/Make/scripts/build, then
# changing the depth in the tree would require repairing the link by hand.  
#
# The build environment can be manipulated temporarily by setting environment
# variables or slightly more permanently using the files with names starting
# with BUILD_ENV as documented in the example for it in src/Make. The use of
# BUILD_ENV is generally meant to be a stop gap measure while portability
# issues are worked out, but there is also some facility for personalizing
# preferences. This facility is implemented in build-2, as this file, which is
# duplicated as described above, should be kept to the minimum needed for
# "bootstrapping" the build.

# This next part is shared by all files in Make whose names begin with "build",
# AND kjb_add_makefiles. Updates should be propogated.
