# This script must be run in your src directory. Typically, that is $HOME/src,
# but it need not be, especially if you feel the need to have multiple versions.
# If you run this script in a different directory, then it will create some
# files and directories that you will need to remove. 
#
# This script relies on the fact that svn check out also serves fine as svn
# update.
