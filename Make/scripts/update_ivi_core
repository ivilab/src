# Identification:
#     A script to update core IVI software
#
# Description:
#     This script updates the core IVI software using SVN. The "core" system is
#     the build system, the library, some utility programs ("tools"), and some
#     example programs. It currently excludes programs for research projects,
#     but this might change. Alternatively, we might write a script
#     "update_ivi_all". 
#
#     This script must be run in your source directory. Typically, that is
#     $HOME/src, but it need not be, especially if you feel the need to have
#     multiple versions.  If you accidentally run this script in an unintended
#     directory, then you will need to remove the directories that it created.
#
#     If you have already checked out "Make" into your source directory, and you
#     are in that directory, then this script can be run as:
#     |    Make/scripts/update_ivi_core
#     Alternatively, and probably ideally, some instance of "Make/scripts" is in
#     your path.
