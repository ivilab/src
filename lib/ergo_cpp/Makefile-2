# Template for Makefile-2 for a library directory. Usually operated on by the
# script ivi_add_makefiles. 
#
# The directory that we are in should have a different name than any IVI library
# sub-dirs. 
#
# Replace 'ergo' with the directory name, and ERGO with the upper case
# counterpart.  The string that replaces 'ergo' should not already be a sub-dir
# of IVI library. 
#
# Then, DELETE this comment block, because it is no longer a template!
